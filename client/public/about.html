        <br>
        <p>The WECE Maker Garage is a collaborative environment for hackers and makers 
           to utilize state of the art equipment such as 3D printers, depth cameras,
           wearable hardware, PCB prototyping tools, and much more. The Maker Garage gives 
           engineerings and developers the ability to join forces on ideas and skills to turn 
           engineering dreams into reality. Our space allows for fast paced prototyping and encourages 
           early failures in design and development to ensure the most robust end products. The Maker 
           Garage is open to everyone during certain hours. Please be sure to check the calendar before 
           stopping by! We hope to see you soon.
