# SE-Project
This is where we will create our Client's Product.

We plan to make a website which is viewing accessible by everyone, and modifiable accessible by some
The website consist of a schedule which displays the different admins occopances in the Maker's Garage
It also displays the current capacitance of the Maker's Garage, and ensures it does not exceed a given limit (We believe this limit will be 5 people at a time)

We plan to integrate a API based off of Google Calendars to create the interface, and use specific modules (Which will be specified down the line when we learn more) to make it user friendly
The basis for the system is the website will prompt an Admin Log-In when any given user tries to use one of the modification tools on the website, and it will not allow them to use it unless they log-in to an Admin Account
